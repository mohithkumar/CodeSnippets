Depth First Search for Graphs
Premise for the program:
- A graph consists of a number of nodes and edges.
- An edge is made up of 2 nodes.

This program provides the following:
- Ability to add an edge (pair of nodes) to the graph
- Remove an edge from the graph
- Determine whether the graph is connected or not
- Iterative Depth First Search (DFS), using STL Stack, of the entire graph
- Iterative Depth First Search (DFS), using STL Stack, between any 2 given nodes.
- Return the number of nodes in the graph

The program basically builds an AdjacenyList from the input nodes and uses this AdjList for iterating through the graph.
