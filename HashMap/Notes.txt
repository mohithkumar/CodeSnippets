Word Frequency calculator using HashMap
Program description:
The working of this program can be divided into 2 broad things:
A) Building HashTable
1. Requests user for a filename
2. Determines whether the given file is ASCII text file
3. If not ASCII text file, prints a message and exits
4. (If ASCII text file), It parses the file, reads every word and builds HashTable.
5. HashTable is basically an array of pointers to HashNodePtr.
6. Each element of the array, in turn points to a HashNode that has the same HashValue.
7. Each HashNode contains a word, its count and pointer to the next node.
8. For every word read from the file, its HashValue is calculated and is inserted into the HashTable adjacent to corresponding array element having same HashValue.
9. If the word already exists in HashTable, its count in the respective node is incremented else a new HashNode is created.

B) Counting the frequency of occurrence of words and retrieving the 'K' most common words.
1. A Binary Search Tree is constructed from each of the nodes in HashTable.
2. First 'N' number of words in the descending order of their frequencies are printed out.
